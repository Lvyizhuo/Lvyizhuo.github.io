# About me

  

### Hi there, I'm Yizhuo Lv 👋

  

I am pursuing a Master's degree at **[Qilu University of Technology (QLU)](https://www.qlu.edu.cn/)**, with [Chong Di](https://teacher.qlu.edu.cn/rgzn/dc2/main.htm) as my supervisor. Concurrently, I serve as a Research Intern at the **Medical and AI Team** of the **[Shandong Artificial Intelligence Institute (SDAI)](http://sdai.net/)** from 2025 to 2027.

  

With a core focus on bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical application, my primary research interests include:

- **Graph Representation Learning**

- **Reinforcement Learning**

- **Graph Neural Networks**

- **Dynamic Social Networks**

- **Dynamic Influence Maximization**

  

I am also actively exploring cutting-edge frontiers in **Agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

  

Beyond academic pursuits, I possess hands-on experience in technical development and am enthusiastic about collaborative opportunities in the following areas:

- **Intelligent Agent Development**

- **Java Backend Engineering**

- **Python-Based Application & Algorithm Implementation**

- **WeChat Mini Program Development**

- **Server Administration & DevOps Practices**

  

Feel free to connect if you’re seeking a collaborative partner to co-create innovative projects or explore cross-disciplinary applications!
